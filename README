NAME
    RT-Extension-NotifyWebex - RT ScripAction Webex Teams integration

DESCRIPTION
    Allow for Webex notifications to be sent out via RT, heaving inspired by
    RT-Extension-NotifySlack.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 5.0.3.

INSTALLATION
    "perl Makefile.PL"
    "make"
    "make install"
        May need root permissions

    "make initdb" See the CONFIGURATION section below before running this
    command. Only run this the first time you install this module. If you
    run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your database.
    Edit your /opt/rt5/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::NotifyWebex');

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt5/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
    You must configure a $WebexToken to authenticate against the Webex APIs
    using a webex Bot.
    https://developer.webex.com/docs/bots#creating-a-webex-bot

    You must also add the rooms which the integration posts to by id in
    %WebexRooms

    Example configuration:

        Set($WebexToken, '<mywebextoken>');
        Set(%WebexRooms,
            'test'  => '<room1 id>',
            'room2' => '<room2 id>',
        );

    The 'Notify Webex' ScripAction posts to one webex room. The default room
    is currently set to 'test'. You can update this in the initialdata file
    by changing the 'Notify Webex' ScripAction Argument to the desired webex
    room To post to additional webex rooms, copy the ScripAction giving it a
    new Name and Argument, something like "Webex Updates To Support".
